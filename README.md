# pokemans2

First attempt at a somewhat full-stack application, where the everything is built from the ground up using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

ROADMAP:

> 08/22/2022 > Decided to make the REPO from private to public. At this point in time, there is a start to a landing page, and a shell of an express server

> 08/26/2022 > Got tired of using VScode's LiveServer extension due to persisting issues. Decided to utilize the shell of the express server to accomplish the same thing by hooking it up to nodemon, and attaching the landing page to the express server. Works almost identically to the Live Server extension, except that I have to refresh the html page each time an adjustment is made to the code.

> 08/27/2022 > Was originally going to try and put together an API for all the pokemans, but did some research and   found out that there is already an API that exists for the pokemans. Adding the API to a new resources list.

> 08/29/2022 > Changing one of the buttons to be a random Pokeman button that will show the Pokadex entry for one of the original 150 pokemans. This will utilize the API. not sure if it should be implemented as a button or a pop-out side panel.

> 08/31/2022 > Created a functional slide panel, which will either contain a random Pokeman entry, or a minigame. It works, but it needs to be polished a bit in order to look how its supposed to look.
